# Fav github repos

A app to see your repositories and mark like favorites.

This app is connected with [netlify](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiX2Jn9uo2AAxWDRDABHaGJBioQFnoECB4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netlify.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3sXtvDCHEM_yMr7dqTH7xl&opi=89978449) (to deploy changes to production on each commit in main) and [supabase](https://supabase.com/) (to make an ease connection between this and github OAuth apps).

the routes are:

```
/
/login
/register
/list-repos
/list-repos-fav
/profile

```
Each route represent a different component (except /, use same component that /list-repos).
